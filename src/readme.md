The pipeline to crawl songs from Netease Music

1. run `song_list.py` to generate a json file about popular playlist
2. run `list2song.py` to generate the song ids from the json file generated by the last step
3. run `get_lyric.py` to crawl lyrics from the song ids


* ``song_list.py`` : to crawl playlist of different categories, modify the code of  `Netease_spider.originURL` and run.

* `list2song.py` : to crawl the song ids of the playlist, says `rock-list.json`, modify the code in line 137 to `crawl = Netease_song("rock")` and run.

* `get_lyric.py` :

    ```shell
    usage: get_lyric.py [-h] --src SRC --dst DST [--proxy PROXY]
    ```
